This project implements a video classification pipeline using deep learning. It extracts frames from videos, processes them using PyTorch and torchvision, and trains a neural network to classify actions. It includes dataset handling, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Optimized for GPU acceleration with efficient memory management.
